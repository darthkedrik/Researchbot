# Researchbot

This repository is the workings of a Sociolinguistics bot developed to pull from websites to study the effects of anonymity in online speech.

The usage of materials within is free for all academic purposes, and was first developed during the course of the paper Anons and Normies: A Study of Impoliteness, Swearwords, and Sentiments in Anonymous Speech Online by Keith Edward Diedrick, published by Montezuma Publishing at San Diego State University as partial requirement for a Masters of Arts in Linguistics.

Each new folder is a different part of the bot. As coding skills develop, it may be rewritten into new versions. All code so far is in python 2.7
